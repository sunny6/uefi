How to gnu-efi 

1. Insatll gnu-efi
2. Write Program and Makefile (Example files are attached)
3. Compile program
        Make sure that you may need to adjust the EFIINC, LIB, and EFILIB variables to point to the
        relevant portions of your GNU-EFI installation directory. EFIINC should, of course, point to 
        your GNU-EFI include files; LIB should point to the directory that holds the libefi.a and libgnuefi.a files; 
        and EFILIB should point to the directory that holds the crt0-efi-x86_64.o and elf_x86_64_efi.lds files 
        (or equivalents for another architecture).

4. Download efi-shell link:- https://edk2.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/edk2/trunk/edk2/EdkShellBinPkg/FullShell/X64/Shell_Full.efi

5. Rename downloaded files as shellx64.efi

6. Place them in the root directory of ESP

7. Create entry in grub config to load efi-shell (Ex /etc/grub.d/40_custom)

Ex :- menuentry "EFI shell" {
        insmod part_gpt
        insmod chain
        set root='(hd0,gpt1)'
        chainloader /shellx64.efi
}

9. Update grub and reboot (update-grub)

10. Launch EFI shell, and type fs0: to change to the first filesystem,
which is normally the ESP.
You can then type hello.efi to launch the program.
output

Shell> fs0:

fs0:\> hello.efi
Hello, world!

fs0:\> exit

<efi.h>



GNU-EFI includes four things:

        crt0-efi-x86_64.o: A CRT0 (C runtime initialization code) that provides an entry point that UEFI firmware will 
                           call when launching the application, which will in turn call the "efi_main" function that the developer writes.

        libgnuefi.a: A library containing a single function (_relocate) that is used by the CRT0.

        elf_x86_64_efi.lds: A linker script used to link UEFI applications.

        efi.h and other headers: Convenience headers that provide structures, typedefs, and constants improve readability when accessing the 
                                System Table and other UEFI resources.

        libefi.a: A library containing convenience functions like CRC computation, string length calculation, and easy text printing.

        efilib.h: Header for libefi.a.
